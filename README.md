# s2t (Speech 2 Text)

`s2t` is a lightweight, toggle-style dictation utility. Run it once to start recording, run it again to stop, transcribe with Whisper, and paste into the focused application.

## Platform Guides

- **Linux (tested on Arch + X11)**: `linux/README.md`
- **macOS (experimental)**: `macos/README.md`

## Status

- Linux implementation is developed and tested on **Arch Linux + X11** (DWM + Dunst) using **whisper.cpp from the AUR**.
- macOS support is **experimental** and untested beyond basic setup.

If you’re on a different distro, compositor, or desktop environment, expect some tinkering.
